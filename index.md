CTAT Disk Log Converter



Use the CTAT Disk Log Converter to convert a CTAT disk log to a more readable XML format.

When disk logging is enabled, CTAT produces log files that are heavily escaped so that the 
bulk of the XML can be transported inside another XML element. This XML-within-XML format is 
very difficult for a human to read but easy for DataShop. The CTAT Disk Log Converter "unescapes" the XML and provides 
some reasonable spacing to make the XML format easier to read.
